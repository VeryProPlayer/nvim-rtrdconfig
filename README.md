# 🧰 How to Install Neovim on Linux

Neovim is a powerful, modern version of Vim designed for better extensibility and performance. Follow the steps below to install it!

## 🧩 Step 1: Update Your System
Run these commands to make sure your system is up to date:


## Debian or debian based distros(Ubuntu,Linux Mint etc,)

sudo  `apt` update:

## For Arch Linux or arch based distros (Artix Linux ,Manjaro etc )
sudo `pacman` -Syu

## For Fedora or fedora based distros(Rocky Linux,Redhat etc)
sudo `dnf ` update

## 💿 Step 2: Install Neovim
To install neovim you'll need to use your package manager to install neovim.
## Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S nvim
## Debian
sudo apt install nvim
## Fedora
sudo dnf install nvim
----
To open up neovim you'll need to enter 'nvim' and that's it\
`fun fact:` you don't need to close the terminal to exit nvim or vim (that wasn't funny , I know)

## 🧠 Useful Commands Inside Neovim
- `:q` → Quit  
- `:w` → Save file  
- `:wq` → Save and quit  
- `:help` → Open Neovim help  
- `i` → Enter insert mode  
- `Esc` → Exit insert mode  \

  `fun fact:` You don't need :q to exit vim what's even better and also faster in my opinion is  by holding shift and pressing  ZZ\
  In this config I'll be using `lazyvim` which will make things way simpler in my opinion.
